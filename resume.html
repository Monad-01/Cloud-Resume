      <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
      <p>
        I am a seasoned self-motivated professional with an exceptional track record of initiating and participating in large-scale IT and customer service-related operations. With over 3+ years of IT experience in Java development, application analysis, and testing, I have assisted in securing an enterprise banking application by working on a CyberArk migration project. I am looking to advance my career with a leading organization that will allow me to further grow as an IT professional.
